### Projects üêæ  
1. [Animal Adoption Management System](https://github.com/timigyurina/Animal_Adoption_Management_System_Backend)
This is the backend of the pet project I am currently working on. Its aim is to make the adoption process of animals from different shelters easier by keeping data in one compex system.
The application may not be complete, as I am continuously working on the frontend and may need to make updates and extend its functionalities.  

2. [API Wars](https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/api-wars-react-timigyurina)
A Codecool project built with the use of the MERN stack. I highly enjoyed this project and therefore I made a well-designed, responsive UI for it.

3. [Grande Hotel System](https://github.com/timigyurina/el-proyecte-grande)
A team project created during four weeks using ASP.NET backend, React frontend and a persistent Postgres database.
